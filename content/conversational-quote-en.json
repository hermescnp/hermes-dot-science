    "centralized-sources": "This means your team mainly goes to one or two main places to find what they need - like a company database, your main software system, or a central file server. If most of your information lives in just a few key systems that everyone knows about, this is you.",
    "distributed-sources": "This describes teams that use several different tools and platforms regularly - maybe you have a CRM system, a project management tool, some cloud storage, and a few other specialized applications. If your team has to check 3-6 different places to get their work done, this fits your situation.",
    "everywhere-sources": "This is when information is scattered everywhere - in email threads, various databases, different file systems, people's personal folders, chat messages, and sometimes just in people's heads. If finding information feels like a treasure hunt across many different places, this describes your current reality.",
    "quick-answers": "Think of this like having a smart search engine that can instantly answer common questions your team asks repeatedly. If your team often needs quick facts, status updates, or simple answers to routine questions, this would be perfect for you.",
    "guided-conversations": "This is like having a knowledgeable assistant that can have back-and-forth conversations, understand what you're really asking for, and help you work through problems step by step. If your team needs help thinking through complex situations or multi-step processes, this would serve you well.",
    "voice-interactions": "This means talking to your AI assistant out loud, like you would with Siri or Alexa, but for your business needs. This is ideal if your team works with their hands, drives vehicles, or is often away from keyboards where speaking would be more convenient than typing.",
    "background-automation": "Think of this as having an invisible assistant that handles routine tasks automatically without you having to ask. If your team spends time on repetitive tasks like data entry, status updates, or routine notifications, this would work behind the scenes to handle those things.",
    "intelligent-assistant": "This is like having a smart team member that learns your patterns, anticipates your needs, and gets better over time. If you want an AI that adapts to how your team works and becomes more helpful as it learns your preferences, this is the right choice.",
    "team-coordination": "This means having an AI that can manage communications and tasks across multiple people, departments, or even external partners. If your work involves coordinating between different groups or managing complex projects with many moving parts, this would be valuable.",
    "essential-tools": "This covers the basic business tools most companies use - things like email, calendar, customer management (CRM), and maybe accounting software. If your team mainly uses these fundamental business applications, this level of integration would work for you.",
    "business-suite": "This includes a full range of business applications - everything from the basics plus project management tools, communication platforms, accounting systems, and other operational software. If your business runs on a comprehensive set of tools and applications, this describes your needs.",
    "specialized-ecosystem": "This means you use industry-specific software along with standard business tools - like medical practice software, legal case management, manufacturing systems, or other specialized tools unique to your field. If your industry requires specific software that general businesses don't use, this applies to you.",
    "standard-reliability": "This is typical business-level dependability - the system works well most of the time, but occasional brief outages or minor issues are acceptable. If a few minutes of downtime here and there wouldn't significantly impact your operations, this level is sufficient.",
    "high-availability": "This means the system is critical to your daily operations and needs to be available almost all the time. If your team relies heavily on the system to get their work done and downtime would noticeably slow down productivity, you need this level of reliability.",
    "enterprise-grade": "This is for systems where any downtime directly costs you money or significantly impacts your business. If customers can't be served, sales are lost, or critical operations stop when the system is down, you need this highest level of reliability.",
    "launch-support": "This means we help you get everything set up and running smoothly, train your team, and then hand it over for you to manage internally. Choose this if you have technical staff who can handle ongoing maintenance and updates, or if you prefer to manage systems internally.",
    "ongoing-partnership": "This means we continue working together after launch to optimize performance, add new features, and help the system grow with your business. This is ideal if you want continuous improvement and prefer to have expert support available as your needs evolve.",
    "strategic-evolution": "This is a long-term partnership where we help your AI capabilities evolve as your business changes and grows. Choose this if you see AI as a key part of your future strategy and want a partner who will help you stay ahead of the curve as technology advances.",
    "structured-reports": "This means your information comes in organized, predictable formats - like standard reports, dashboards with charts and graphs, or database queries that always look the same. If most of your information is already organized in tables, reports, or structured formats, this describes your situation.",
    "mixed-formats": "This describes having some organized information (like reports and databases) mixed with less structured content (like emails, documents, and team discussions). If your information comes in various formats - some organized, some not - this fits your reality.",
    "unstructured-heavy": "This means much of your important information exists in documents, images, recordings, presentations, or just in people's knowledge and experience. If finding information often requires reading through documents, asking colleagues, or searching through files, this describes your current situation.",
    "cloud-native": "This means you use modern, web-based software that's designed to work well with other systems - like Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, or other contemporary cloud applications. If most of your tools are accessed through web browsers and are relatively new, this describes your setup.",
    "mixed-environment": "This describes having a combination of newer cloud-based tools alongside older systems, custom-built software, or on-premise applications that your company has used for years. If you have some modern tools mixed with legacy systems or custom solutions, this fits your situation.",
    "operational-metrics": "This means you want to track basic system performance - things like whether it's working properly, how often people use it, and if there are any technical problems. Choose this if you mainly need to know that the system is running well and being used effectively.",
    "business-intelligence": "This means you want to understand the business impact - like how much time the system saves, whether it's improving productivity, if customers are happier, and what return you're getting on your investment. Choose this if you need to demonstrate business value and make data-driven decisions about the system."
